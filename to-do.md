# Sheetsee To-Do List

### MAPS
- Popup Content, I guess needs to just all be pulled out. Don't see another way?
- GeoJSON Content can be fed in the needed info but users are limited to three items, not ideal. 
-- Create a variable on index page and pass it in. 
-- Make fit bounds work

### TABLES
- Do I have enough kinds of filtering functions?
- How to trace the dataset source that created a table so that you can sort different tables.
- Filtering/Sorting doesn't work on mobile

### CHARTS
- when you have multiple charts, the highlight occurs over the each charts because they repeat the index number
- Jquery action on making the charts responsive?

### DOCUMENTATION
- Do lots of beautiful Documentation
- Example projects
-- Penny Map
-- Hack Spots
-- Max Project
-- WBEZ Project

### GENERAL  
- Update site
- Make client-side version

### EXTRA
- Make all data points relate to each other
-- Unique ids?
