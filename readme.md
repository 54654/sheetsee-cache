# Hello!

I'm building on a CfA project of mine, [Sheetsee.js](http://jllord.github.io/sheetsee.js), thanks to a Mozilla-Knight Foundation Code Sprint Grant. 

### Server-side and Client-side

I'm planning on building a server-side and client-side version. The client-side version will remain the most approachable and easy to stand up. The server-side version will have niceties like caching the data on the server to eliminate waiting on Google.

Both will have a lot more than exists now. Below is my working to-do list. 

## Both
* clean stylesheet
* super duper documentation
* 3 d3 chart options
* map
* templating 

## Client-side
* save data to browser storage for local development

## Server-side
* Save data to server to avoid hitting Google for every request
* Use stored data for offline, local development


#### Super in-progress.

## To Run

node server.js
